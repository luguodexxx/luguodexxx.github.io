- project: Circular RNAs
  description: Circular RNAs, as a newly emerging RNA species, have been identified in multiple species and different cell lines. But knowledge of their biogenesis machinery has remained limited. My work revealed some novel biogenesis clues for two distinct types of circular RNAs. One type of circular RNAs is derived from excised introns (circular intronic RNAs), and we discovered their processing depends on a consensus motif containing a 7 nt GU-rich element near the 5’ splice site and an 11 nt C-rich element close to the branchpoint site (Mol Cell, 2013). Another type of circular RNAs is from back-spliced exons (exonic circular RNAs), and we demonstrated that exon circularization is dependent on flanking intronic complementary sequences (e.g. IRAlus) and the efficiency of exon circularization can be regulated by competition between RNA pairing across flanking introns or within individual introns (Cell, 2014).

- project: Alternative Splicing
  description: Alternative splicing allows exons to be joined in different variations to form alternative transcripts, which greatly increases the diversity of transcriptome encoded by a limited number of genes. My projects mainly focused on how alternative splicing contribute to the regulation of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs). By exploring non-polyadenylated transcriptomes, one new type of lncRNAs with snoRNA on their ends (snoRNA-related lncRNAs, sno-lncRNAs) were identified from multiple species, and we revealed that the expression of sno-lncRNAs is species-specific and that their processing is closely linked to alternative splicing of their parent genes (BMC Genomics, 2014). Alternative splicing analysis of non-polyadenylated transcriptomes also helps us to systematically annotated different types of alternative back-splicing and alternative splicing events in circRNAs from various cell lines, and compared with their linear cognate RNAs, circRNAs exhibited distinct patterns of alternative back-splicing and alternative splicing (Genome Res, 2016).
